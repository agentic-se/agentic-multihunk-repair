# codec-13: Patch Equivalence 

**Summary:**
This folder contains two patches that both make **Codec-13** pass all tests. The ground-truth fix edits the original buggy file, while the Claude-generated fix implements the needed function **at the call site** instead of modifying the ground-truth location. This is a classic case of *repair success without localization success*.

## Files

* `Codec_13_ground_truth.diff` — Hunk4J ground-truth patch.
* `Codc_13_claude.diff` — Patch generated by Claude Code.

## What happened

* ✅ **All tests pass** with both patches.
* 🧭 **Localization mismatch:**

  * *Ground truth:* Developer edit patch.
  * *Claude patch:* **does not** modify all of the ground-truth files; it defines/implements the needed function **where it’s used**, bypassing the external edit location in another ground-truth file.
